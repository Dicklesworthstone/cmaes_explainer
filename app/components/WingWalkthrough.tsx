        Let’s simplify the wing to just three normalized parameters
        <MathJax inline>{"$x_1, x_2, x_3 \\in [0,1]$"}</MathJax>: aspect ratio, sweep, and an airfoil
        family index. Physical ranges map linearly into the unit cube; the categorical airfoil index
        is carved into five sub-intervals and later quantized. Normalizing like this keeps the
        initial Gaussian honest; every direction starts equally plausible. The real pipeline would
        be hours of meshing + CFD per point, so every generation has to count — that’s the regime
        where CMA-ES earns its keep.

        The rhythm looks like this: sample a batch, run the expensive simulator, rank, and update.
        The evolving ellipsoid is an online PCA of “what worked,” steadily aligning to benign
        directions (e.g., sweep + aspect ratio together) and squeezing dangerous ones (high aspect
        ratio with low sweep). By the mid-game generations you’ve converted ignorance into a tailored
        metric without ever seeing a gradient.

        The important part is what we <em>don’t</em> assume. We never assume the objective is convex
        or even smooth. We just assume that sampling around the current mean and steering the
        covariance toward where good things have happened in the past is a reasonable meta-strategy.
        CMA-ES is the formalization of that idea with careful math underneath: invariance from
        rank-based selection, natural-gradient flavored updates in distribution space, and restart
        policies (IPOP/BIPOP) when you need to sweep multiple basins.
